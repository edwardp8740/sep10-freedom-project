# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Edward Perez Gomez**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Architecture**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **A-frame** in order to help me make my website.

My website's purpose is to help inform people of architeceture and give a starting point for current and future architects that might need help finding hardware tools to help make their experience faster and easier, and software apps that could help with making 3D art more clearer and easier to draw.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Global
  * Big systems 
    * Website instead of a long article
  * Environment
    * People can find hardware and software about architecture online
* Social
  * Individual
    * Architecture's/Future architecture's will be able to find a website easily about tools they can use or just learn about tools that might be useful in the future
    * Normal artist can also find 3D softwares to help them draw in 3D or tools to make drawing in general easier
  * Culture
    * People who draw in general will have a base on apps they can use to draw in 3D even if it's unrelated to architecture
* Economic
  * Jobs
    * Architecture's could find tools to make daily things in their job easier
  * Finance
    * Companies could see my idea of an invention and make it real which will lead to architectures having an easier time with jobs
  * Infrastructure
    * All images are not dependent on othe websites so if images from other websites go down the images will still stay up on my webstie

##### CONS
* Social
  * Individual
    * Although there is somethings for artist in general, it mostly focuses on architecture and 3D art revolving around architecture.
* Economic
  * Infrastructure
    * My a-frame is connected to my website so I can't show people my invention when my website goes down.
