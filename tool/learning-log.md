# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **A-frame**

---

### 3/3/25:
* I went on youtube to find more videos about A-frame and tutorials about it
* I didn't really learn much yet and still have a lot of questions
 * What can A-frame do?
 * Can A-frame also run animations or do some form of animation?
 * If it can run animations how do they work and how does it look like?
### 3/10/25:
* I made an atom to get more used to making other shapes and using differnt a-frame shapes.
  * I used a new a-frame shape called torus and it's like a ring shape.
* I'm searching up some more a-frame tutorials to see what answers from last log I can get answered
  * I found out that animation is possible
  * To test out animation in aframe, I took the atom I made from before and made it spin like a normal atom would do in real life in [aframe-animation-testing-3.html](aframe-animation-testing-3.html).
    * I managed to make it spin and rotate a bit but it doesn't end in the same position it started
      * (If you want to see the spin use w, s, d, a to move to the side of the atom to see the spin in full action)
      * I wonder how to make it end in the same position it started off at
### 3/17/25
* From my last log I was left off wondering how to make my atom end up in the same position it started off at and to answer this question I went to find videos
  * I found a video using a different way to make animation possible in a-frame and wanted to [test](aframe-animation-testing-2.html) it out
    * After testing it out, it didn't work it could've been to a-frame being more updated now since the video was 6 years old so it could be an outdated version of a-frame
  * I couldn't find much else about this question
* Although I came empty hand from my last question I did try my own version of making it stay still
  * I couldn't figure it out and it ended up just rotating around the person
* A question I still have is to make it end in the same position it started off at
  * I have a theory it might not be possible but I still have to see
  * I'm going to do more research about this question if I find nothing then I will leave it for now and focus on other stuff
### 3/24/25
* I couldn't find anything about before so I will leave it for now and focus on developing my knowledge of the aframe I already know
* Today I'm going to do something a little bit bigger
  * I will make a scenery
    * Mini project for myself using aframe to develop using it
    * To do this I will use some of the new shapes I tested in [aframe-shapes.html](aframe-shapes.html)
    * I decided to make a forest scenery, I made trees some more close together and others further apart to give it a more realistic type of vibe and big rocks for more style, as well as small pebbles on the floor like real pebbles you find in a forest
      * New shapes I will use in this scenery: dodecahedron, icosahedron, cylinder, cone
      * Color I used:
        * Grass: #136d15
        * Rocks: gray
        * Tree leaves: #0D3309
        * Tree Trunk: #5C2C06
      * Shapes and their purposes
        * Dodecahedron & icosahedron: rocks/mini rocks
        * Cylinder: Tree trunk
        * Cone: Tree leaves
