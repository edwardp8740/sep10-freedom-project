# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **A-frame**

---

### 3/3/25:
* I went on youtube to find more videos about A-frame and tutorials about it
* I didn't really learn much yet and still have a lot of questions
 * What can A-frame do?
 * Can A-frame also run animations or do some form of animation?
 * If it can run animations how do they work and how does it look like?
### 3/10/25:
* I made an atom to get more used to making other shapes and using differnt a-frame shapes.
  * I used a new a-frame shape called torus and it's like a ring shape.
* I'm searching up some more a-frame tutorials to see what answers from last log I can get answered
  * I found out that animation is possible
  * To test out animation in aframe, I took the atom I made from before and made it spin like a normal atom would do in real life in [aframe-animation-testing-3.html](aframe-animation-testing-3.html).
    * I managed to make it spin and rotate a bit but it doesn't end in the same position it started
      * (If you want to see the spin use w, s, d, a to move to the side of the atom to see the spin in full action)
      * I wonder how to make it end in the same position it started off at
