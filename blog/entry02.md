## Research

Ever since we choose our topics we've beeen gathering info on our topic, more specifically the software and hardware of our topic. Mine was architecture so I researched about the software and hardware in architeture. For exmaple. I searched up on google "architecture apps" for the software part of my research. I found a interesting [webstie](https://www.archdaily.com/896021/the-top-apps-for-architects) that gave me a list of apps that work best for architecture, as well as a breif review of what they do and how it's good for architecture. I later used this webstie to research an [app](https://www.autodesk.com/ae?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com) to see what it contained and could do. After I finished my software research, I moved on to hardware research. At first I searched "What kind of devices do people in architecture use" and found one [webstite](https://www.hellobonsai.com/blog/tools-that-architects-use) that gave me stuff about tools for digital drawing and not really tools used in architecture, so I changed my search to "architecture gadgets". This helped me find a [website](https://www.journeyofanarchitect.com/blog/25-tools-and-devices-for-architects) an actual architect wrote and the tools they used as an architect. I was able to get tools like a 3D scanner, VR headsets, and laser measure. I was also able to get info about these tools and how they can be useful.

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently on the second step of the engineering design process, (Research), moving to step 3, (Brainstorm). I think I'm in a good place right now because I don't think I'm behind on anything and I have some good info for my website. To get ahead, I will try to start step 3, brainstorming.
