# Entry 1: Choosing My Topic
##### 10/7/24
## Why This Topic?
The topic that I have chosen for the year-long project is **architecture**. I chose this topic because my father has always wanted an architect to help him with his construction business. I also love to draw and want to learn more. I think buildings can look really beautiful because of architect, especially buildings with old designs and even modern ones. It's really pushed me to want to learn more about architecture and learn how to do it. My two backup ideas are music and construction in general!

Two links I have thought about exploring is [New architecture technologies for advanced building design](https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/technology-architecture) and [The Future of Architectural Design and Integration](https://aia-nj.org/blog/2024/02/02/embracing-technology-the-future-of-architectural-design-and-integration/). These websites seem to have a lot of info that are written in a simple form so I think I will have an easier time reading and taking notes as well get a lot of notes about my topic. These websites also have a lot of stuff about architecture and technology. All of these notes will come in handy in the future when we get more in depth with the project. 

## Engineering Design Process
I am currently on the first step, (step 1), and a bit of the second step, (researching), of the EDP, (engineering design process). A problem I hope to solve with my project is that people think technology won't help architecture. I plan on asking my friends about their opinion and ideas and use that to help me find possible solutions as well just ideas for future technology in architecture.

## Skills
Some skills I've learned are:
* How to Google
* Time Management

#### How to Google
One skill I learned is **How to Google**. This skill was really helpful to learn since a big part of this project will be about researching. Before I learned this skill I searched up "Architecture", of course a lot of stuff about architecture showed up as well as drawings which was fun to see, but nothing about the relationship with architecture and technology. After learning this skill I searched up "technology in architecture" which gave me many websites with modern day technology in architecture as well as opened up my mind to possible ideas for future technology in architecture and solutions. I know this will come more than handy in the future when I research more.

#### Time Management
Another skill I learned is **Time Management**. I plan to join the volleyball team so I go early in the school and have Strength and Conditioning after school at 3:30, so managing my time has become really important because I'm usually tired from waking up earlier and from Strength and Conditioning club. I've come up with a new schedule that works for me and helps me get all my homework like coding homework done. I try doing all my homework between the time I have after school, 2:25-3:30, before I get home so I can just rest when I get home. I'm sure this will become really helpful in the future for my SEP class and my other classes.

## Summary
Overall I think this project will be fun and a good way to learn about a possible future career in architect!
