### Content

After making our MVP and fixing stuff beyond our MVP's, we had to do a in-class [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-tjGcgwiMV9km7QVV8wr-SCDV-0W9Kl5RL2HBdOG3aE/edit?slide=id.g357fec61999_0_375#slide=id.g357fec61999_0_375) and a [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h97wqHWzEsgEUPgjLQRvweKtANPWRgp_vzu99dRglK4/edit?tab=t.0). Although we only really did each thing once, I got a lot of takeaways for each thing.

**Elevator Pitch Takeaways:**

There were a couple of takeaways I got from my elevator pitch and one of the biggest one was **Confidence Sells**. I felt as though I could've been more confident with my elevator pitch and use my body language more. I also wasn't looking at my judges as much as I think I should've. Not just that, but to actually show that I have something meaningful and useful to show, I have to show confidence. I have show confidnece to have really proved to my judges that I had something that could help people, or in my case prsent or future architects. Another takeaway I had was to **Focus on the Keypoints**. I think I was too focused on other stuff that didn't matter as much intead of more important stuff like the purpose of my project or my future invention idea. Not just that, but I could've gone more into detail about the purpose of my website and my invention. 

**In-class Presentation Takeaways:**

One of the biggest takeaways I got from my presentation was to **Adapt to the Room**. While I was up presentinig I could see that some of my classmates got confused in areas where I was explaining my codes and challenges I came across, so instead of letting them stay confused I went into detail and pinpointed the sepcific areas where all the stuff was happening. It made my presentation so much more smoother and clearer for my audience and it will also help for future audiences. Another big takeaway I got from my presentation was **Structure Matters**. A logical and more structured flow keeps things simplier for the audience. It also helps keep audiences engaged and helps them follow the message of the presentation. For this reason I kept my slides with little to no words in order to avoid big walls of texts that might've disengaged my audience. I also used pictures and simluations wisely throughout my presentation inorder to enhance my points while still keeping it entertaining and informative  throughout my presentation.

### Skills

A skill I improved on **Communication** especially for elevator pitch and presentation. I had to learn how to communicate in a positive way by not just using my words, but also other things. For example, body language became a huge part when doing presentation, people would become disengaged to a presentation where the person just stand awkardly or fidget too much to focus. Another example is tone, if you had a enthusiastic tone with the courage to want to presentation, your audience would become 10 times more engaged. People would want to listen in and see what you have to offer. These two things were things that helped me make my presentation clear and informative while still being engaging and entertaining for my audience.

Another skill I improved on was **Consideration**. When I was presenting my challenges, I could tell that in some areas my audience got confused and in order to bring them back and not just leave my audience confused, I went more into detail to help bring them up to speed with my presentation. This was something I learned in the moment, but I think it's something that will be very useful when I'm trying to think about multiple people during presentations or elevator pitches because it helps my audience understand my points better. Not just that, but it also keeps my audience up to speed with the whole presentation, it gives them a sense of ease to know that if they are confused that I am willing to explain for a better understanding and clearer thought process.

### Engineering Design Process

I think I was on step 8 when I was doing my elevator pitch and presentation, but now I think I finished the whole process of the EDP. For the future projects that I will make, I will try to add everything I've learned from this year long project like webdesign and stuff from a-frame. Not just that, but I will also try and use all the skills, takeaways, and other real world tools I've learned from the past year to help improve projects I will make in the future.
