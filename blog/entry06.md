After learning things about our tool and trying to use it to it's best we had to make our MVP, (Minimum Viable Product). Basically we had to make the bare minimum to make our website work. I started off making my MVP by making my plan in my [plan.md](../prep/plan.md), my plan consisted of making a wireframe first for phone users and computer users then finding other stuff I could add in the website. After that I planned out a timeline of what I would get done to finish my MVP and other things I would get done after finishing the MVP. Though along the way of trying to finish my MVP some challenges I came across were just fixing small bugs to make my website look good at the bare minimum. For example, when making my invention using aframe I had to find all the right height, width, depth and position to make my invention look more serious, because otherwise I could've left it like a mess and as a nonserious invention idea that wouldn't help people in the future.

Here's some code to show the same details I needed to make to make it look like an actual serious invention idea.
``` HTML
<a-entity position="0 -5 -46">
  <a-box color="blue" position="-3 3 -5" height="10" width="1" depth="1" opacity=".5"></a-box>
  <a-box color="blue" position="3 3 -5" height="10" width="1" depth="1" opacity=".5"></a-box>
  <a-box color="blue" position="0 7.5 -5" height="5" width="1" depth="1" opacity=".5" rotation="0 0 90"></a-box>
  <a-box color="blue" position="0 3 -5.5" height="10" width="5" depth=".00001" opacity=".5"></a-box>
  <a-sphere color="blue" position="2 2.75 -5.5" radius=".5" opacity=".5"> </a-sphere>
</a-entity>
```
All these numbers with decimal I had to find on my own which was super frustrating and time consuming a lot of the times because if I over estimated the position or dimensions then I had to go back to my code, change it, and go back to check if it was all right. Another challenge I came across was fixing my cursor because at the start my cursor would just click every second and it made it so that it was impossible to look around or even do anything in my aframe.

Here's the code of my cursor before
