### Brainstorming Future and Finalizing All Content

Before we finalized all of our content, we had to brainstorm for a future idea that could help your topic in some way or make it easier. So when I was thinking of a future idea, I went back to my notes to find some inspiration. At first I looked at the websites I found for hardware to see what inventions were already made. Although it did help me a bit, I actually got my idea from the software part of my notes. My idea came from two apps, [Chief Architect](https://www.chiefarchitect.com/) and [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/ae?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com).Â I saw how they had a 3D drawing option on their app, and it got me thinking, what if instead of only being able to see it from a computer or tablet, you could also see it in person? That's how my idea started; I came up with a hologram projector that could show the design of a building an architect came up with. This had a few big features, like being able to see the building as a whole or individual rooms, changing design and furniture in the building in real time, etc.

After coming up with an idea we had to finalize our content.
