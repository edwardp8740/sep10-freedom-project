### Brainstorming Future and Finalizing All Content

Before we finalized all of our content, we had to brainstorm for a future idea that could help your topic in some way or make it easier. So when I was thinking of a future idea, I went back to my notes to find some inspiration. At first I looked at the websites I found for hardware to see what inventions were already made. Although it did help me a bit, I actually got my idea from the software part of my notes. My idea came from two apps, [Chief Architect](https://www.chiefarchitect.com/) and [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/ae?utm_medium=website&utm_source=archdaily.com).Â I saw how they had a 3D drawing option on their app, and it got me thinking, what if instead of only being able to see it from a computer or tablet, you could also see it in person? That's how my idea started; I came up with a hologram projector that could show the design of a building an architect came up with. This had a few big features, like being able to see the building as a whole or individual rooms, changing design and furniture in the building in real time, etc.

After coming up with an idea we had to finalize our content. What we did was organize all of the notes, check if we had anything missing, made sure we had pictures for our website, etc. After we checked everything and organized everything in a document, our teacher checked and gave us personal feed back. I didn't get any feedback which meant I did a good job organzing everything.

### Engineering Design Process
I would say I just finished step 4 of the EDP, engineering design process, and I'm onto step 5. So I will evnetually start working on making the actual website and adding everything or almost everything I've been working on over the year.

### Skills

Over the time from my last entry a skill I've learnt was **Organization**, especially for notes. Before my notes were orgainzed on just software and hardware tools which was working with me, but after getting a lesson about organizing notes and putting them into categories it made my notes much easier to read and to find stuff.

Another skill I've improved was **Creativity**. At the time when we were told to come up with a invention for the future, I just couldn't think of anything. My mind was basically blank, but after some time of thinking I realized that I didn't need to think so hard on it because I was supposed to be creative. That's when everything started becoming more clear to me and my creativity started coming back.
