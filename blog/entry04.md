### Content

Ever since we finalized all of our content, we decided to choose a tool to add to our future website like a-frame, SASS, etc. For my tool I decided to choose a-frame. A-frame is a tool that can run 3D simulations and even can even run in VR. I thought this would work perfectly with my invention because it would give the person a visual to see when they think about my invention. It could also help me explain the functions to my invention. Before choosing locking in the tool we would use, we had to test it out first. I decided to look for youtube tutorial videos on a-frame. After some searching I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JePvWQWUVs) and I followed it's instruction on how it worked and some of its function. When I got the hang of it, I decided to [make my own thing using a-frame](../tool/aframe-testing-1.html), at first I made a plain simple face but then I made a simple snowman.

Here's the code of the snowman itself
``` HTML
<a-scene>
  <a-sky color="blue"></a-sky>
  <a-plane rotation="-90 0 0" color="white" height="500" width="100"></a-plane>
  <a-sphere position="6 .5 -4.5" color="white" radius="1" shadow></a-sphere>
  <a-sphere position="6 1.75 -4.5" color="white" radius=".75" shadow></a-sphere>
  <a-sphere position="6 2.75 -4.5" color="white" radius=".5" shadow></a-sphere>
  <a-cone position="6 2.70 -4" color="orange" radius-bottom=".1" radius-top=".00000000001" height=".5" rotation="90 90 90"></a-cone>
  <a-sphere position="5.8 2.9 -4.05" color="black" radius=".05"></a-sphere>
  <a-sphere position="6.2 2.9 -4.05" color="black" radius=".05"></a-sphere>
</a-scene>
```

And here's the code for the simple face
``` HTML
<a-scene>
  <a-sky color="blue"></a-sky>
  <a-sphere position="-.5 3.5 -4.5" color="black" radius="0.5" shadow></a-sphere>
  <a-sphere position="2.5 3.5 -4.5" color="black" radius="0.5" shadow></a-sphere>
  <a-box position="1 1.5 -4.9" color="black" width="4" height=".5"></a-box>
  <a-box position="1 2 -5" color="#e0ac69" width="6" height="6"></a-box>
  <a-plane rotation="-90 0 0" color="white" height="500" width="100"></a-plane>
</a-scene>
```
### Skills 

Two skills I learned/improved on was:
* **Consideration**
* **How to learn**

Learning A-frame wasn't exactly easy because it had many elements and attributes to it. I was trying to learn it all by myself on my own by testing everything and the attributes, but it was really hard, so instead I went to go find YouTube videos to explain the basic sum up of A-frame. After this, I found it much easier to do A-frame, and I think now that I don't have to learn it on my own and can go to other tools to help me learn faster and better.

While choosing my tool, something I really had to think about was consideration, because this whole project is about how we can help people with all sorts of topics. I decided to get some of my peers help on my invention; this really helped open my view to what people might want, what they wouldn't want, and what they might need in my invention to help them. Now I should be able to think about stuff people might need and want in the future and questions to ask myself when considering the needs and wants of others.
