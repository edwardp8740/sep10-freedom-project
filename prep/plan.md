| Xin Yu  |I think you did an great job on, making the Aframe tool interaciveble and you can press buttons and sort of stuff   | I think making your website colorful is also another good aspect of your website, so I think next time you could put some background color. I'm not saying black and white is bad but I think it should be more colorful at the same time. The image of the carousel doesn't work
|  Bah |  I like the cool background architecture at the start | You could try reviewing your carousel and fixing the non-moving images.
|  Leo | I like when yiy add a behind the scene link  | i think you should add differet types of bookstrap element becauses i dont see alot.
